## 1. Introduction

In today’s fast-paced IT industry, professionals are expected to continuously upgrade their technical skills and apply concepts in real-life projects. However, busy schedules and limited resources often become barriers to learning and practice.

To address this, Aptech introduces **eProjects** — a synchronous learning environment that allows students to implement knowledge step by step. This project simulates real-world scenarios, helping students to:

- Practice implementation in a phased, laddered approach  
- Build larger, more robust applications  
- Learn integration of multiple modules into a unified application  
- Work on real-life case studies  
- Gain industry-like experience in coding, testing, and documentation  

**This eProject focuses on building an Online Book Store application using ASP.NET.**
